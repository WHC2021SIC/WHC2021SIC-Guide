## Repositories

Teams must release by 11:59 p.m. PST on June 25 ~~18~~ their software that runs on Raspberry Pi platforms through their landing git repository in the [WHC2021SIC](https://github.com/WHC2021SIC) github organization, including their software components and forks, to be released publicly under an open-source license.

Teams must publish a documentation of their project on a public git repository with markdown text files and compatible media files to support the replication of their project, including: 
- hardware
   - bills of materials, 
   - assembly guide, including sensors wiring, 
- software 
   - installation,
   - running instructions.

Please refer to the structure of the latest [project template](https://github.com/WHC2021SIC/WHC2021SIC-ProjectTemplate) for WHC 2021 SIC repositories.

**TODO** We will soon provide updates about ready-to-run flashable images of filesystems.
